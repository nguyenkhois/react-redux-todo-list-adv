# React-Redux - To-Do list
## How you view
You should view step by step when you want to know more about React-Redux in this example:
* Step 0 (`index.js`): Data structures
* Step 1 (`reducer.js`): Creating reducer
* Step 2 (`actions.js`): Creating actions
* Step 3 (`todos.components.js`)
   * Step 3a: Creating React props from actions by using mapDispatchToProps()
   * Step 3b: Creating React props from Redux state by using mapStateToProps(). It used like local state.
   * Step 3c: Creating React class component with its props that were created on above steps. View more on `lists.component.js`
* Step 4 (`todos.components.js`): Creating a container component by using connect() function
* Step 5 (`index.js`): Creating a store
